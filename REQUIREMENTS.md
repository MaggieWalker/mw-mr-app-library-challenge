## Coding Exercise
For this exercise you will create a simple web application that does the following:
## Requirements
[] Allow the user to search for a book.
[] Fetch and display a list of results from the Open Library API (https://openlibrary.org/developers/api).
[] Allow the user to sort and filter results.
[] Allow the user to click on a result and view additional details, including at least cover art and description.
If you don't finish within the time allotted, that's okay; submit what you've got anyway.

[] For the front end, please use HTML, CSS, React, and Redux. You can use whatever back end technology you want as long as it can be executed in a Unix environment.

We take the following factors into account when reviewing your submission, in addition to the above requirements (this list is not exhaustive):

[] Good, clean code
[] Sensible app design
[] UI and ease-of-use
[] Documentation (for example, a README)
To submit the exercise, 
1. Deploy the application to some public location where we can interact with it (e.g. AWS S3, Heroku)
2. Push the code to GitHub or some other code hosting service, or send us an archive of your local git repository.
Please send code that you are proud to show us!
